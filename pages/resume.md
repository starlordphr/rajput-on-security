### Research Experience
My projects are focused on solving critical problems in Cyber Security, applications of Machine Learning in interdisciplinary fields, Cloud Computing and Digital Humanities.

- [**Phish Armor**](https://github.com/starlordphr/PhishArmor)
  * Proposed and developed a metadata based approach for defending against email spear phishing attack.
  * Extended Levenshtein Distance and MySQL queries for identifying suspicious emails.
  * Optimized the solution by reducing search space using additional MySQL query.
  <br /><br />
- [**Automated NFV Deployment**](https://github.com/starlordphr/Automated_NFV_Deployment)
  * Developed a command line tool to automatically deploy OAI components using OpenStack.
  * Implemented automated scripts for OAI configuration based on user specified modular SLA files.
  * Introduced simple interactive functionality to deploy, delete and check status of the spawned VMs.
  <br /><br />
- [**Secure Code Analysis**](https://github.com/starlordphr/Secure_Code_Analysis)
  * Proposed a novel technique to detect violations of secure coding techniques using abstract symbol tree in Java.
  * Extended Google’s Error Prone to analyse the code for security vulnerabilities during compile time.
  * Detected vulnerabilities such as weak random number generation and return value ignored in open source projects.
  <br /><br />
- [**Location Stream Privacy**](https://github.com/starlordphr)
  * Studied different neural network configurations for understanding its effect on location stream data.
  * Applied feed forward neural network for mobility pattern classification on location stream data.
  * Extended the solution to recurrent neural network for minimizing error to a maximum of 1.
  <br /><br />
- [**Application for Preventing Runtime Information Gathering on Android OS**](https://github.com/starlordphr/Defender-RIG-Prevention)
  * Designed and implemented 3 new Runtime Information Gathering (RIG) attacks targeting Android OS.
  * Implemented a solution for each RIG attack using behavior - based malicious application detection system.
  * Optimised the solution by 85% for better performance using multithreading in Java.
  <br /><br />
- [**Machine Learning for Cancer Treatment Prediction**](https://github.com/starlordphr/Cancer_Treatment_Prediction)
  * Proposed a novel technique using clinical data for predicting best treatment option for cancer patients.
  * Implemented multiple machine learning techniques using TensorFlow and scikit library in Python.
  * Modified the algorithm to obtain an accuracy of upto 85%.
  <br /><br />
- [**Software Development for Personal Cloud File Sync**](https://github.com/cmuthapp/CS219_FileSync)
  * Implemented automated personal cloud system using Python.
  * Improved the software to incorporate SSL protocol for secure transfer of data.
  * Achieved significantly less meta data transfer by using delta based approach.
  * Shifted from master based architecture to semi-master based approach, where data is transferred peer-to-peer and master is used only for meta data transfer.
  <br /><br />
- [**Design and Development of ASCII Transliteration Format (ATF) Parser**](https://github.com/starlordphr/ATF-Checker)
  * Developed a parser to validate ATF texts using PLY in Python.
