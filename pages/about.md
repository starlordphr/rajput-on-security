Hello! I'm Prashant Rajput, a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at New York University (NYU) and the author of [Rajput On Security](https://rajputonsecurity.com). The main idea behind this website is to create a platform where we talk about not only the recent Cyber News but also about the current research being done in the Cyber Security community. To read my upcoming posts early, please go to my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/starlordphr/rajput-on-security/tree/master/_drafts).

To know more about me, please feel free to go through my [personal web page](https://prashanthrajput.com/).
