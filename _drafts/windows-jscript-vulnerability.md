title: Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Windows JScript Component
tags: [Cyber News]

---

A vulnerability was recently discovered in the JScript component (Microsoft's custom implementation of JavaScript). The vulnerability allows an adversary to execute malicious code on a user's computer.

Dimitri Kaslov of Telespace Systems discovered the vulnerability and passed it along to Trend Micro's Zero-Day Initiative (ADI), a project that intermediates the vulnerability disclosure process between independent researchers and large organizations.

The vulnerability is not yet patched in Windows and so the details of the attack are not available. According to its summary, the vulnerability allows a remote adversary to execute malicious code on user's PC. Since the vulnerability exists in JScript component, the only condition for the attack is that the user must access the malicious website or download the JScript file and open it.

The flaw exists in how Error objects are handled in JScript. The attacker can reuse freed pointers to execute code in the current context of the process. Since the flaw is in JScript, the malicious code can only run in a sandbox environment and therefore it cannot lead to a full system compromise.

The vulnerability received a 6.8 rating out of 10 on the CVSSv2 severity scale and Microsoft still intends to patch the vulnerability in the coming weeks.
